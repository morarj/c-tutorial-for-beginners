	C# vs .NET
	CLR (Common Language Run-time)
	Architecture of .NET Application
	Our First C# Application
6. C# vs .NET
	C# is a programming language
	.NET is a framework for building applications on Windows
		CRL (Common Language Runtime)
		Class Library
7. What is CLR?
	C/C++
		App -> Compile -> Native Code (Machine code)
	C#
		App -> Compile -> Intermediate Language (IL) Code -> CLR | Just-in-time compilation (JIT) -> Native Code 
8. Architecture of .NET Applications
	C#
		Classes
			Container which has attributes and methods
			EJ
				Car
				Make, Model, Color
				Start(), Move()
		Namespace 
			Container for related classes
		Assembly (Dinamically Linked Library (DLL) or EXE)
			Container for related Namespaces
		On compilation the compiler builds assemblys
9. Getting Visual Studio
	1-Get-Visual-Studio.pdf
10. Our First Application
	File->New->Project->Visual C#->Windows->Console Application
		HelloWorld
	AssemblyInfo is the information and the indentification for the assembly that will result from compiling
	App.config xml for the configurations of the application. ConnectionsStrings or Settings
	
	Program.cs
		using to add the namespaces. System, System.Collections.Generic
		namespace HelloWorld
			class Program
				static void Main(string[] args) {}
		Methods have inputs and outputs

		Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
		
		Run using Ctrl + F5
11. What is ReSharper?
12. Summary
	C# vs .NET
		C# is a programming Language and .NET is a framework. It consists of run-time enviroment (CLR) and a class library we use for building applications.
	CLR
		When compiling C# compiles it IL (Intermediate Language) which is plataform agnostic, to run it on a different piece of hardware CLR is needed. CLR compiles IL code to machine code, process which is called just-in-time Compilation (JIT)
	Architecture of .NET Applications
		Classes (Methods and Attributes) -> Namespaces -> Assemblys
		Assemblys are EXE or DLL
		EXE can be executed
		DLL file that includes code that can be re-used across diferent programs
